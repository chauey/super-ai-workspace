# Folder Structure Guide

## Overview
This document explains the organization of the Angular application, specifically the difference between `app/angular/` and `app/features/`.

## Directory Structure

## Key Differences

### `app/angular/` - Tutorial Content
- **Purpose**: Contains all Angular tutorial/learning components
- **What's inside**: The actual component files for teaching Angular concepts
- **Examples**: 
  - `empty.component.ts`
  - `signals.component.ts`
  - `reactive-forms.component.ts`
- **Keep or Delete**: ✅ **KEEP** - These are the actual tutorial content

### `app/features/angular/` - Routing Configuration
- **Purpose**: Feature module that encapsulates Angular tutorial routes
- **What's inside**: Only route configuration files
- **Examples**:
  - `angular.routes.ts` - Route definitions
  - `angular-feature.config.ts` - Feature module config
- **Keep or Delete**: ✅ **KEEP** - These provide modular routing

### `app/features/{other}/` - App Features
- **Purpose**: Top-level application features (not tutorials)
- **What's inside**: Complete feature modules with components and routes
- **Examples**:
  - `design-system/` - UI component library
  - `dashboard/` - Landing page
  - `docs/` - Documentation viewer
- **Keep or Delete**: ✅ **KEEP** - Core app features

## Why This Structure?

### Separation of Concerns
1. **Tutorial Content** (`app/angular/`): 
   - Components that teach Angular concepts
   - Organized by learning path
   - Part of the "Angular" learning section

2. **App Features** (`app/features/`):
   - Top-level application features
   - Each is a complete feature module
   - Can be lazy loaded independently

### Route Organization
```typescript
// Main routes (app.routes.ts)
{
  path: 'angular',
  children: angularFeatureRoutes  // From features/angular/
}

// Angular feature routes (features/angular/angular.routes.ts)
{
  path: 'core-concepts/signals',
  loadComponent: () => import('../../angular/core-concepts/signals.component')
  //                           ↑ Imports from app/angular/
}
```

## What Was Cleaned Up?

### ❌ Deleted: `app/angular/design-system/`
- **Reason**: Duplicated folder
- **Moved to**: `app/features/design-system/`
- **Why**: Design System is a top-level feature, not an Angular tutorial topic

## Adding New Content

### Adding Angular Tutorial Content
```bash
# Create in app/angular/
ng g c angular/new-category/new-tutorial --standalone

# Then add route in features/angular/angular.routes.ts
{
  path: 'new-category/new-tutorial',
  loadComponent: () => import('../../angular/new-category/new-tutorial.component')
}
```

### Adding New App Feature
```bash
# Create in app/features/
ng g c features/new-feature --standalone

# Create route file
# features/new-feature/new-feature.routes.ts

# Add to main routes (app.routes.ts)
{
  path: 'new-feature',
  loadChildren: () => import('./features/new-feature/new-feature.routes')
}
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep Angular tutorial components in `app/angular/`
- Keep routing configuration in `app/features/angular/`
- Put new app features in `app/features/{feature-name}/`
- Use lazy loading for better performance

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't mix tutorial content with app features
- Don't create duplicate folders
- Don't put feature modules in `app/angular/`
- Don't create routes directly in components

## Migration Notes

If you were following the old structure where everything was in `app/angular/`, here's what changed:

1. **Design System**: Moved from `app/angular/design-system/` to `app/features/design-system/`
2. **Dashboard**: Created in `app/features/dashboard/` (new)
3. **Docs**: Created in `app/features/docs/` (new)
4. **Angular Routes**: Organized in `app/features/angular/` but still import from `app/angular/`
